## Introduction

**Decentralized Science (DeSci)** merges **blockchain** and **cryptocurrency** technologies with **scientific research** to create more transparent, open, and equitable frameworks for knowledge creation and dissemination. By leveraging smart contracts, DAOs, token incentives, and decentralized governance, DeSci has the potential to **revolutionize** how scientific work is conducted, peer-reviewed, funded, and shared globally.

**Awesome DeSci** is a **community-driven** collection of curated resources to help:

- **Newcomers** understand the DeSci movement  
- **Researchers** discover new funding and collaboration opportunities  
- **Developers** explore tools and protocols to build DeSci solutions  
- **Enthusiasts** stay updated on this fast-evolving landscape  

---

## What is DeSci?
**DeSci** leverages **decentralized technologies** (like blockchain, IPFS, DAOs) to:

- **Democratize** access to data and discoveries  
- **Tokenize** participation and encourage open-source collaboration  
- **Reward** reproducibility and fair peer review  
- **Empower** global scientific communities, easing reliance on traditional gatekeepers  

---

## Key Principles of DeSci

1. **Openness & Transparency**  
   - Open-source code, data, and research outcomes  
   - Immutable on-chain record-keeping for methods, peer review, and funding

2. **Decentralized Governance**  
   - DAOs and community-led structures to fund and direct research

3. **Fair Incentives**  
   - Token or NFT-based rewards for contributions (data sharing, peer reviews, etc.)

4. **Inclusion & Accessibility**  
   - Lower barriers to global participation  
   - Support for researchers in underrepresented regions

5. **Collaboration & Interoperability**  
   - Modular protocols and frameworks to enable cross-project synergy
